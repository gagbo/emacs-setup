# My GNU Emacs setup

Thanks to [this talk by @hrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4),
I got the motivation to Org my configuration, so the commments that I
actually want to make are nicely formatted in emacs, in github, and also
in any output format that I want.

To see the setup, see [Configuration.org](configuration.org)
